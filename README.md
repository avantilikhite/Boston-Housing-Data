# Boston-Housing-Data
This is a very quick run-through of some basic statistical concepts, adapted from Lab 4 in Harvard's CS109 course.

Here is the list of concepts covered:
#### Linear Regression Models
#### Prediction using linear regression
#### Some re-sampling methods
- Train-Test splits
- Cross Validation

Linear regression is used to model and predict continuous outcomes while logistic regression is used to model binary outcomes. We'll see some examples of linear regression as well as Train-test splits.

The packages covered are: `statsmodels`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
